# Blind-Valley-Puzzle-Solver

Developed a backtracking algorithm to solve the "Blind Valley" puzzle, a combination of "Blind Alley" and "Valley" games. 
The objective was to fill a grid with domino-like tiles while adhering to specific placement constraints. The solution 
involved recursive backtracking and constraint satisfaction, with a visual representation of the puzzle state using 
color coding (Green for Base, Brown for High, and Gray for Neutral). The program prints the completed grid or 
"No solution!" if no valid solution exists.
